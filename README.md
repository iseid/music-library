# music-library

An older program written to read a text file containing track information (title, album, artist, year) that organizes the file in a format similar to that of a music progrgam such as iTunes. 

The program will print a neat list of the tracks and calculate the cost of the tracks based on their release year.

You are able to sort and search the track list.
